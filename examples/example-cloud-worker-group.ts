/**
 * Cloud Worker Group Management Example
 * 
 * This example demonstrates how to create and manage a cloud-based worker group
 * in Cribl Stream using the Control Plane SDK. It shows:
 * 
 * 1. Creates a cloud worker group with AWS provider configuration with
 *    24MB/s max estimated ingest rate / 9 worker processes
 * 2. Verifies the worker group doesn't already exist
 * 3. Scales the worker group up to 48MB/s max estimated ingest rate / 21 worker processes
 * 4. Provisions the worker group to activate cloud resources
 * 
 * Check this documentation for more details about ingest rates and provisioning:
 *   https://docs.cribl.io/stream/cloud-workers/#create-a-cloud-worker-group
 * 
 * Prerequisites: Configure cloud environment variables: ORG_ID, CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, WORKSPACE_NAME
 * How to get these values: https://docs.cribl.io/api/#criblcloud
 *
 * Note: This example is for cloud deployments only and does not require a .env
 * file configuration to run.
